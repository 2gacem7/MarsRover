*DISCLAIMER* You don't need to complete all of the steps below. This app just serves as a basis of discussion for our technical talk in the next step. Do not spent more than 6 hours on this.

We've split our features in steps, with an increasing complexity.

### Phase 1

Use the "Mars Rover Photos" API section to load the first page of the "Curiosity" Rover photos. You can use a grid layout, similar to the mockup provided (feel free to be creative if you feel like it, but we're not after your design skills here :-) ).

### Phase 1 response : 




### Phase 2

As there's potentially several pages of images available for some of the rovers, think of a nice UI pattern that will give the chance to the user to browse all available images. Think "Infinite". You could use a technique to 'throttle' your API requests.

### Phase 2 response : 



### Phase 3 - nice to have

Your Product owner would like to offer some filtering to the end users. Add a sidebar/left column to your layout with a form element (please choose what you think is best: textbox, dropdown, select, radio?).  The element should give the possibility to change the Rover (Curiosity, Opportunity, Spirit)
